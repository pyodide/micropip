      # IMPORTANT: always build sdist, and then the wheel from
      # the sdist (like it is currently done here). This is
      # because we want to ensure that no extra files get
      # copied, which can be the case with building in-tree.
      # The MANIFEST.in file ensures that the sdist doesn't
      # contain any unnecessary files.
