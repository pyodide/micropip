## [0.2.0] - 2022/12/12

### Added

- Support for adding mock packages, for use where something is a dependency and you don't need it, or you need only a limited subset of the package. This is done using `micropip.add_mock_package`, `micropip.remove_mock_package` and `micropip.list_mock_packages`. Packages installed like this will be skipped by dependency resolution when you later install real packages.
  [#26](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/26)


### Fixed

- When multiple compatible builds for a package exist, the best
  build is now installed, as determined by the order of tags in
  [`packaging.tags.sys_tags`](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/tags.html#packaging.tags.sys_tags).
  For example, if a package has two pure Python wheels, one tagged `py30` and
  another tagged `py35`, the `py35` wheel will now always get installed.
  [#34](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/34)
- `micropip.install` now supports installing packages by URLs with query parameters
