## Unreleased

## [0.7.2] - 2024/11/26

### Fixed

  [#159](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/159)

## [0.7.1] - 2024/11/11

### Fixed

- Fixed bug that prevented package installation from `file:` path in Node.js environment.
  [#155](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/155)

## [0.7.0] - 2024/11/09

### Fixed

- `micropip.install` now works with simple http indexes that use relative
  links when referencing wheels. [#150](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/150)

### Added

- `micropip.install(index_urls=[...])` parameter now supports the special value
  `"PYPI"` to refer the `http://pypi.org/simple/` index instead of having to
  type the full url.

## [0.6.1] - 2024/10/05

### Fixed

- micropip.install and micropip.uninstall now accepts `verbosity=None`
  which does not overwrite a default log level.
  [#132](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/132)

- When multiple index urls are given, micropip.install will now correctly
  fallback to the next index url when one index url fails to find a package.
  [#129](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/129)

## [0.6.0] - 2024/01/31

### Fixed

- micropip.install can now locate shared libraries in `<pkg>.libs` directory.
  This is consistent with the behavior of pyodide.loadpackage.
  [#97](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/97)

## [0.5.0] - 2023/09/19

### Changed

- When custom index URLs are set by `micropip.set_index_urls` or by `micropip.install(index_urls=...)`,
  micropip will now query packages from the custom index first,
  and then from pyodide lockfile.
  [#83](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/83)

- Made micropip.freeze correctly list dependencies of manually installed packages.
  [#79](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/79)

## [0.4.0] - 2023/07/25

### Added

- Added `verbose` parameter to micropip.install and micropip.uninstall
  [#60](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/60)
- Added `index_urls` parameter to micropip.install to support installing
  from custom package indexes.
  [#74](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/74)
- Added `micropip.set_index_urls` to support installing from custom package
  indexes.
  [#74](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/74)
- Added support for Simple API (PEP 503 / PEP 691)
  [#75](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/75)
### Fixed

- Fixed `micropip.add_mock_package` to work with Pyodide>=0.23.0
  [#66](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/66)

### Changed

- The default index URL is changed to https://pypi.org/simple
  [#75](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/75)

## [0.3.0] - 2023/03/29

### Added

- Added `micropip.uninstall` to uninstall packages
  [#55](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/55)

## [0.2.2] - 2023/03/04

### Fixed

- When there is an invalid version on PyPi (defined as unparsable
  by [`packaging.version.Version`](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/stable/version.html))
  that version is now skipped. Otherwise a single invalid version would
  make the package uninstallable, following removal of `LegacyVersion` in
  [packaging#407](https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/407).

### Fixed

## [0.2.1] - 2023/02/20

### Changed

- micropip now depends on packaging>=0.23.0
  [#49](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/49)

## [0.2.0] - 2022/12/12

### Added

- Support for adding mock packages, for use where something is a dependency and you don't need it, or you need only a limited subset of the package. This is done using `micropip.add_mock_package`, `micropip.remove_mock_package` and `micropip.list_mock_packages`. Packages installed like this will be skipped by dependency resolution when you later install real packages.
  [#26](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/26)


### Fixed

- When multiple compatible builds for a package exist, the best
  build is now installed, as determined by the order of tags in
  [`packaging.tags.sys_tags`](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/tags.html#packaging.tags.sys_tags).
  For example, if a package has two pure Python wheels, one tagged `py30` and
  another tagged `py35`, the `py35` wheel will now always get installed.
  [#34](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/34)
- `micropip.install` now supports installing packages by URLs with query parameters
  [#33](https://github.com/pyodide/micropip/pull/33)
