    Set the index URLs to use when looking up packages.

    - The index URL should support the
        `JSON API <https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json/>`__ .

    - The index URL may contain the placeholder {package_name} which will be
        replaced with the package name when looking up a package. If it does not
        contain the placeholder, the package name will be appended to the URL.

    - If a list of URLs is provided, micropip will try each URL in order until
        it finds a package. If no package is found, an error will be raised.

        A list of URLs or a single URL to use as the package index.
