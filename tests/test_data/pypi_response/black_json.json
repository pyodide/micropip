By using it, you agree to cede\ncontrol over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,\ndeterminism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time\nand mental energy for more important matters.\n\nBlackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting\nbecomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.\n\n_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.\n\nTry it out now using the [Black Playground](https://black.vercel.app). Watch the\n[PyCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.\n\n---\n\n**[Read the documentation on ReadTheDocs!](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)**\n\n---\n\n## Installation and usage\n\n### Installation\n\n_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.7+ to run.\nIf you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install \"black[jupyter]\"`.\n\nIf you can't wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/psf/black`\n\n### Usage\n\nTo get started right away with sensible defaults:\n\n```sh\nblack {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nYou can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:\n\n```sh\npython -m black {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nFurther information can be found in our docs:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n_Black_ is already [successfully used](https://github.com/psf/black#used-by) by many\nprojects, small and big. _Black_ has a comprehensive test suite, with efficient parallel\ntests, and our own auto formatting and parallel Continuous Integration runner. Now that\nwe have become stable, you should not expect large formatting changes in the future.\nStylistic changes will mostly be responses to bug reports and support for new Python\nsyntax. For more information please refer to the\n[The Black Code Style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html).\n\nAlso, as a safety measure which slows down processing, _Black_ will check that the\nreformatted code still produces a valid AST that is effectively equivalent to the\noriginal (see the\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#ast-before-and-after-formatting)\nsection for details). If you're feeling confident, use `--fast`.\n\n## The _Black_ code style\n\n_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in\nplace. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn't\ntake previous formatting into account (see\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\nfor exceptions).\n\nOur documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are\nalso documented. They're both worth taking a look:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html)\n\nChanges to the _Black_ code style are bound by the Stability Policy:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Stability Policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be\nintended behaviour.\n\n### Pragmatism\n\nEarly versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its\ninitial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and\nthere were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,\n_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.\n\n- [The _Black_ code style: Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document\nabove. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.\n\n## Configuration\n\n_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options\nfrom a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom\n`--include` and `--exclude`/`--force-exclude`/`--extend-exclude` patterns for your\nproject.\n\nYou can find more details in our documentation:\n\n- [The basics: Configuration via a file](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)\n\nAnd if you're looking for more general configuration documentation:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n**Pro-tip**: If you're asking yourself \"Do I need to configure anything?\" the answer is\n\"No\". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults. Applying those defaults will have your\ncode in compliance with many other _Black_ formatted projects.\n\n## Used by\n\nThe following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent\ncode style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs,\nSQLAlchemy, Poetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv),\npandas, Pillow, Twisted, LocalStack, every Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant,\nZulip, Kedro, OpenOA, FLORIS, ORBIT, WOMBAT, and many more.\n\nThe following organizations use _Black_: Facebook, Dropbox, KeepTruckin, Mozilla, Quora,\nDuolingo, QuantumBlack, Tesla, Archer Aviation.\n\nAre we missing anyone? Let us know.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n**Mike Bayer**, [author of `SQLAlchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/):\n\n> I can't think of any single tool in my entire programming career that has given me a\n> bigger productivity increase by its introduction. I can now do refactorings in about\n> 1% of the keystrokes that it would have taken me previously when we had no way for\n> code to format itself.\n\n**Dusty Phillips**,\n[writer](https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dusty+phillips):\n\n> _Black_ is opinionated so you don't have to be.\n\n**Hynek Schlawack**, [creator of `attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/), core developer of\nTwisted and CPython:\n\n> An auto-formatter that doesn't suck is all I want for Xmas!\n\n**Carl Meyer**, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) core developer:\n\n> At least the name is good.\n\n**Kenneth Reitz**, creator of [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\nand [`pipenv`](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pipenv/):\n\n> This vastly improves the formatting of our code.

In\naddition, there is a small bug fix around imports and a number of improvements to the\npreview style.\n\nPlease try out the\n[preview style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html#preview-style)\nwith `black --preview` and tell us your feedback. All changes in the preview style are\nexpected to become part of Black's stable style in January 2024.\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Import lines with `# fmt: skip` and `# fmt: off` no longer have an extra blank line\n  added when they are right after another import line (#3610)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Add trailing commas to collection literals even if there's a comment after the last\n  entry (#3393)\n- `async def`, `async for`, and `async with` statements are now formatted consistently\n  compared to their non-async version. (#3609)\n- `with` statements that contain two context managers will be consistently wrapped in\n  parentheses (#3589)\n- Let string splitters respect [East Asian Width](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/)\n  (#3445)\n- Now long string literals can be split after East Asian commas and periods (`、` U+3001\n  IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA, `。` U+3002 IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP, & `，` U+FF0C FULLWIDTH COMMA)\n  besides before spaces (#3445)\n- For stubs, enforce one blank line after a nested class with a body other than just\n  `...` (#3564)\n- Improve handling of multiline strings by changing line split behavior (#1879)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Added support for formatting files with invalid type comments (#3594)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Update GitHub Action to use the version of Black equivalent to action's version if\n  version input is not specified (#3543)\n- Fix missing Python binary path in autoload script for vim (#3508)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Document that only the most recent release is supported for security issues;\n  vulnerabilities should be reported through Tidelift (#3612)\n\n## 23.1.0\n\n### Highlights\n\nThis is the first release of 2023, and following our\n[stability policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy),\nit comes with a number of improvements to our stable style, including improvements to\nempty line handling, removal of redundant parentheses in several contexts, and output\nthat highlights implicitly concatenated strings better.\n\nThere are also many changes to the preview style; try out `black --preview` and give us\nfeedback to help us set the stable style for next year.\n\nIn addition to style changes, Black now automatically infers the supported Python\nversions from your `pyproject.toml` file, removing the need to set Black's target\nversions separately.\n\n### Stable style\n\n<!-- Changes that affect Black's stable style -->\n\n- Introduce the 2023 stable style, which incorporates most aspects of last year's\n  preview style (#3418).

(#3233)\n- Faster compiled wheels are now available for CPython 3.11 (#3276)\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n- Windows style (CRLF) newlines will be preserved (#3257).\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Vim plugin: add flag (`g:black_preview`) to enable/disable the preview style (#3246)\n- Update GitHub Action to support formatting of Jupyter Notebook files via a `jupyter`\n  option (#3282)\n- Update GitHub Action to support use of version specifiers (e.g. `<23`) for Black\n  version (#3265)\n\n## 22.8.0\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Python 3.11 is now supported, except for _blackd_ as aiohttp does not support 3.11 as\n  of publishing (#3234)\n- This is the last release that supports running _Black_ on Python 3.6 (formatting 3.6\n  code will continue to be supported until further notice)\n- Reword the stability policy to say that we may, in rare cases, make changes that\n  affect code that was not previously formatted by _Black_ (#3155)\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix an infinite loop when using `# fmt: on/off` in the middle of an expression or code\n  block (#3158)\n- Fix incorrect handling of `# fmt: skip` on colon (`:`) lines (#3148)\n- Comments are no longer deleted when a line had spaces removed around power operators\n  (#2874)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Single-character closing docstring quotes are no longer moved to their own line as\n  this is invalid. This was a bug introduced in version 22.6.0. (#3166)\n- `--skip-string-normalization` / `-S` now prevents docstring prefixes from being\n  normalized as expected (#3168)\n- When using `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` or `-C`, trailing commas are stripped from\n  subscript expressions with more than 1 element (#3209)\n- Implicitly concatenated strings inside a list, set, or tuple are now wrapped inside\n  parentheses (#3162)\n- Fix a string merging/split issue when a comment is present in the middle of implicitly\n  concatenated strings on its own line (#3227)\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n- `blackd` now supports enabling the preview style via the `X-Preview` header (#3217)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Black now uses the presence of debug f-strings to detect target version (#3215)\n- Fix misdetection of project root and verbose logging of sources in cases involving\n  `--stdin-filename` (#3216)\n- Immediate `.gitignore` files in source directories given on the command line are now\n  also respected, previously only `.gitignore` files in the project root and\n  automatically discovered directories were respected (#3237)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Recommend using BlackConnect in IntelliJ IDEs (#3150)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Vim plugin: prefix messages with `Black: ` so it's clear they come from Black (#3194)\n- Docker: changed to a /opt/venv installation + added to PATH to be available to\n  non-root users (#3202)\n\n### Output\n\n- Change from deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` to create our event loop which\n  removes DeprecationWarning (#3164)\n- Remove logging from internal `blib2to3` library since it regularly emits error logs\n  about failed caching that can and should be ignored (#3193)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Type comments are now included in the AST equivalence check consistently so accidental\n  deletion raises an error. Though type comments can't be tracked when running on PyPy\n  3.7 due to standard library limitations.
